I worked alone on this lab. the scanf(" "); in the beginning of the program

and it made blank lines after each call. The printf() and scanf() are

unnecessary inside of those functions. This is useful to become more 

comfortable passing variables to and from functions. I had done most of the lab

last semester and it took me a few hours. The round function took me about an

hour, the solution I came up with was simple and I was making it more of an 

ordeal than necessary.

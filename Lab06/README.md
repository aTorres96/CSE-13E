	I worked alone on this lab although I recieved a lot of help from TAs

Christian and Diego.
	
	Learning how the inturrupts rountines and timers work as well as

programming the board was interesting and seems like it will be very useful in

the future outside of this class. Understanding how the bitwise operations

influence low level functions first hand was insightful and valuable.
	
	
	My initial step is always to read the lab manual to know what were are

expected to write and what I should study to better understand the lab. Prior

to the last quiz I reviewed the bitwise handout which was very helpful in this

lab. I needed a lot of help to get started and stayed as long as I could and, 

asking as many questions as possible. After getting through a couple functions

the operations started to make sense. If I were to do this lab again I would

have attended office hours as soon as I could so that I wouldn't be so rushed 

towards the final day. As always the TAs and lab sections are astronomically 

helpful.

	In the end the lab turned out decently well. I would have liked to

done the extra credit, although I did more in the than I thought I would be

able to. In total the lab probably took me twenty hours including lab

section. The psuedo code in the lab manual was immensly helpful. The hardest 

parts of the lab were starting, and trouble shooting when the build was 

successful and nothing showed up on the Uno32.

	As Max said in lecture the importance of this lab was mainly to be

comfortable accessing and working with files. Using all of the string and 

character functions also seems important although in the end I didn't utilize 

them correctly.

	I thought this lab was fairly straight forward until the LoadRoom

function. I took the usual measures of reading the material, lab manual and 

attending lab section. I also had a few hours worth of trouble trying to use

Visual Studio Code and ended up using MPLabX. In hindsight I would have hired

a tutor for this class, as I will most likely need to for future CS classes. 

I would not have gotten as far as I did if it weren't for the various TAs.

	I was initially excited to write code for any type of game although

ended up feeling frustrated. In the end for some reason the initial description 

only loaded the first letter, and none of the directions caused any other rooms

to load. In lab section the TAs told me my code was correct for the functions 

aside from Lab08_main and LoadRoom and it makes sense that was where the code 

wasn't working properly. It took me about fifteen unsuccessful hours in the end. 

I attended the lab sections and felt I understood what was going on, I most 

likely just needed to put in more time and work.

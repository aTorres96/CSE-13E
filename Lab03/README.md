I thought this lab was interesting, I have not taken

linear algebra so this was a good brain excersize. I thought learning to

construct and organize a library was helpful and should be useful in programming

across the board. Passing by reference is definitely imporant to understand,

although I had previously visited this subject in a c++ course.

My approach to this lab was mainly to understand the patterns in the matricies

on paper so I could clearly see what I had to implement through loops. That was

the most helpful method I can think of. I worked alone on this lab. I spent around

ten to fifteen hours on this lab. I liked finding the patterns in the arrays and 

thought this was a mentally beneficial lab. The hardest part of the lab was the

MatrixMultiply function but after writing out all of the multiplications I

eventually figured out a pattern and how to write the function. The lab manual

gave me as much as I needed to get started, I just had to look up some clarification

on how the math worked to preform the determinant and inverse on matricies.

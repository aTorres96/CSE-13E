	I worked alone in this lab although I recieved help from Christian and

other TA's whose names I cannot recall. 

	I thought this lab was very tedious. It required a lot of testing 

although this was positive in the fact that complex programs require a 

significant amount of testing to ensure their functionality. Using enums and 

#defines created a higher level of organization and clarity than using magic 

numbers. Understanding how the stack works and how to reference and use 

structs was Insightful.

	My approach to this lab was to read the lab manual and try to take the

lab afile at a time. When reading the introduction it seemed a bit intimidating

andthis step by step approach was beneficial. Attending lab section and 

startingthe lab as early as possible was helpful as always.

	In the end my lab worked as it should with the exception of processing

back spaces. I thought that I should write the rpn_test file even though I had

tested the rpn.c file rigurously, hardcoding different strings, and ran out of 

time to complete the process backspaces function.

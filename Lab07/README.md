	I worked alone on this project although recieved help from TAs Brian,

Vaishnavi, DJ, and Chris.

	This lab definitely took the most time, and was the most difficult

so far. The most important aspect of the lab was the implication of the state

machine and the use of trigger event transitions. The Uno32 is a tempremental

instrument and using this as a tool for debugging was very confusing.  

	I tried to get as much help as I could, started the lab early

attended every possible lab section, and read through the lab manual multiple 

times. All of the functions worked well accept there was a problem with my 

timers that I could not figure out. In hindsight I can't say I would have done

much different except spend day and night trying to figure out the problem with

my timer.

	Every time I turned my potentiometer knob past 1:03 it would go back to

zero and start again. As well as when adjusting the temperature it would go

from 300 to 363 start counting up again from 300 repeating this process 5 times.

This added up to the desired 4:15 and I was told my code was correct for 

getting the cook time from shifting the ADC to the right two. I could not

figure out why I was having this problem with the time. In lab section I 

was told my code would work so im hoping the results are better on another

Uno32. TO THE GRADER: The SETUP, and SELECTOR_CHANGE_PENDING work well, the

LEDS function works well although the countdown doesn't work correctly. The

best way to see the best functionality on my end is to set the time to 1:03

in any oven mode. I ended up spending well over 20 hours on this lab.

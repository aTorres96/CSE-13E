	I did not collaborate with any other students on this project. The
 
selection sort took 47.314 milliseconds and the insertion sort took 23.8 

milliseconds. The selection sort is slower because it goes over elements in 

the list multiple while the insertion sort checks the value of each element

only once. This wasn't expected for any reason stemming from any knowledge

of mine, although I assumed, just like any progression, we would learn a slower

version of something first, to see why something else would work more 

efficiently.

	This lab made me comfortable using structs, pointers, and passing them 

to and from functions. I also thought it was important to understand memory

allocation as well as the efficiency in the sort algorithms. Using malloc and

checking the speed of the algorithms creates the oppurtunity to use a more

precise amount of memory and more efficient programming techique.

	The lab went well in the end. I had a couple problems in the auto-grader

that I believe I fixed. Once their was a moment of insight in how everything was

being referenced passed and pointed to the lab seemed efficient and orgonized. I

first read the lab manual and started working on the linked list funtions. The

sort functions took a while, the insertion more than the selection, although

with help from the tutors it all made sense in the end. The lab manual gave me

most of the information I needed, some clarification was helpful just to make 

sure I was on the right track.
